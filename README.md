# VAEs-in-Economics

This project aims to explore applications of Variational Auto-Encoders in Economics. 

In our first effort, we're focusing on a fascinating data set called the American Time Use Survey, a government survey conducted by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The respondents are asked ahead of time to write down their activities during a given 24-hour period. BLS representatives classify the activities of the respondents into 389 different categories, minute-by-minute. Every year’s survey has approximately 11,500 records. The survey is conducted on a rolling basis, so it’s representative of both the population, the days of the week, and the seasons. 

The question we’re going to ask about this incredibly intimate window into people’s lives is can we identify overarching types for describing the overwhelming diversity and baroque intricacy of how people choose to spend their day?
